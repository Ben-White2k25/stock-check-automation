stock-Check Automation & Dashboard (Beginner Project)

Tools: Python • Power BI • GitHub

Built a Python script that simulates checking stock lists for errors (duplicates, missing labels, mismatched quantities), reflecting common issues faced in warehouse operations.

Created a Power BI dashboard visualising error types, frequency, and stock movements over time, demonstrating the ability to turn operational data into insights.

Used GitHub to track changes, log issues, and document the project—mirroring real technical workflows and showing understanding of version control and structured problem reporting.
